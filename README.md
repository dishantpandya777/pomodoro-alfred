# pomodoro-alfred
Alfred workflow for Pomodoro tracking, via [Tomato One (formerly known as Pomodoro One)](http://rinik.net/pomodoro/).

# Usage
Currently supports just one command: `pomo` to start a pomodoro.

# Roadmap
This project is in its infancy and I have plans to extend its usage much further. Some of my ideas include:
- Commands to start and stop a pomodoro
- Commands to start and stop a break
- Support additional pomodoro timer apps
- Show time remaining in current break
- Customizing pomodoro timers
- Viewing pomodoro stats (ie, numbrer of pomodoros completed today)
- Integration with chat platforms, namely Slack
