# pomodoro-alfred
Alfred workflow for Pomodoro tracking, via [Tomato One (formerly known as Pomodoro One)](http://rinik.net/pomodoro/).

# Usage
Type `pomo` to activate the workflow and access all commands. This hotkey can be customized in your Alfred Preferences.

## Commands
* `start`: Starts a pomodoro
* `stop`: Stops the active pomodoro or break
* `break`: Starts a short break

# Roadmap
This project is in its infancy and I have plans to extend its usage much further. Some of my ideas include:
- Support additional pomodoro timer apps
- Show time remaining in current break
- Customizing pomodoro timers
- Viewing pomodoro stats (ie, numbrer of pomodoros completed today)
- Integration with chat platforms, namely Slack
